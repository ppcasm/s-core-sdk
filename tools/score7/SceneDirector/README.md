Okay, so SceneDirector is pretty buggy, especially on newer versons of windows. The way I got it to work so far is as described below.

1. Install SceneDirector_V_1_3_0_2.exe
2. After installation, make a backup of the "Main.exe" app at whatever location it's installed (ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Sunplus\SceneDirector\Main.exe)
3. Now move the "Main - patched.exe" from our tools/SceneDirector folder (where this readme should reside) to the location of the original "Main.exe" (again, ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Sunplus\SceneDirector\Main.exe)
4. If you're on a newer version of windows, it helps to right click on the "Main.exe" app and run in Windows XP compatibility mode, and run as administrator
